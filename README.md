Plant Disease Detection System for Sustainable Agriculture

This project aims to build a convolutional neural network-based solution for classifying plant health by analysing leaf images of crops, including apples, cherries, grapes, and corn. This system will facilitate proactive measures in precision agriculture through accurate identification of specific plant diseases.
